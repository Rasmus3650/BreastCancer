This repository contains our working directories for our project in DL. There are 3 notebooks, two called CNNtest contains a lot of tests and iterations, while finalModel, contains a lot of evaluations and the training of our final 2 models.
The models and data are not included due to the fact that they exceed the limits for GitHub's file storage - if you are interested in the model files, then send an email to 202004625@post.au.dk and i will find a way to get them to you
